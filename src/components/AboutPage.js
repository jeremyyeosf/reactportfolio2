                <p>
                    I am an aspiring software engineer who is interested in
                    improving lives with technology. I have undergone a full-time
                    programme in Full Stack Development under SGUS to develop my
                    skills and invested my time to self-study computer science.

                    My media studies in Polytechnic has also developed my technical
                    support skills. My purpose is to make life easier for others so
                    they can focus their time on things that are more meaningful to
                    them.
